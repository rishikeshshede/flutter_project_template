## ‚ùì How to Use:

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1. Visit [GitHub repository](#).
2. Download the ZIP of this `flutter_project_template` repository and extract it.
3. Copy the extracted folder to the directory where you want to create your new Flutter project.
4. Open a terminal in this copied `flutter_project_template` directory.
5. Grant execution permission to the setup script by running the following command:

   ```sh
   chmod +x scripts/setup_flutter_project.sh
   ```

6. Now, run the setup script with the desired project name:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/setup_flutter_project.sh new_project_name
   ```

7. (Optional) Add the `-d` flag if you want this template folder to be deleted after creating your new project:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/setup_flutter_project.sh new_project_name -d
   ```

8. Run the app.

9. Customize the files as needed and start coding!

    |---/themes                          # UI themes and design
    |---/services                        # API and backend services
    |---/utils                           # Helper functions and constants
    |---/widgets                         # Reusable global widgets
    |---main.dart
|---/scripts                             # Useful automation scripts
|---/test                                # Unit and widget tests
    |---/features
        |---/feature_name
            |---data
            |---domain
            |---presentation
    |---/utils
    |---/core
    |---/integration_tests
    |---/mocks
    |---test_helpers.dart
```

You don't have to waste your time creating all the folders and files for each feature manually. Use the `create_feature.sh` file inside scripts folder in the root directory.

First, provide execution permission to the script:

```sh
chmod +x scripts/create_feature.sh
```

Then, create feature:

```sh
./scipts/create_feature.sh feature_name
```
